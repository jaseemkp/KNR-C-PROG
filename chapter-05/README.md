Chapter 5 - Pointers and Arrays
===============================
A pointer is a variable that contains the address of a variable. Pointers are much used in C,partly because they are sometimes the only way to express a computation, and partly because they usually lead to more compact and efficient code than can be obtained in other ways.
Pointers and arrays are closely related; this chapter also explores this relationship and shows how to exploit it.
